# Project Maturity

cert-manager has wide adoption with it being in use in both production and
non-production clusters. The project is still in an alpha state where it has yet
to reach v1.0.

## API

The cert-manager API is currently in an `v1alpha2` version and as such is
subject to change. We foresee one beta version of `v1beta1` at which we expect
minimal changes, if any, to the next version release of `v1`. We expect to hit
version `v1` late 2019, early 2020.

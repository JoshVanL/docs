# Issuer

`Issuers`, and `ClusterIssuers`, are Kubernetes resources to represent
certificate CA issuers that are able to preset signed certificates by honouring
certificate signing requests. All cert-manager certificates require a referenced
issuer that is in a ready condition to attempt to honour the request.

An example of an Issuer type is CA. A simple CA `Issuer` is as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1alpha2
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: ca-issuer
  namespace: mesh-system
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: ca-key-pair
```

This is a simple Issuer that will sign certificates based on a private key. The
corresponding CA certificate can then be used to trust newly signed certificates
in a PKI system.

## Namespacing

An Issuer is a namespaced resource, and it is not possible to issue
certificates from an Issuer in a different namespace. This means you will need
to create an Issuer in each namespace you wish to obtain Certificates in.

If you want to create a single `Issuer` than can be consumed in multiple
namespaces, you should consider creating a `ClusterIssuer` resource. This is
almost identical to the Issuer resource, however is non-namespaced and so it can
be used to issue Certificates across all namespaces.

## Supported Issuers

cert-manager support a number of 'in-tree' as well as 'out-of-tree' issuer
types. An exhaustive list of these issuer types can be found in cert-manager
configuration documentation. TODO: add link to issuer config page.

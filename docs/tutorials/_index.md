# Tutorials

It is strongly recommended that users are familiar with concepts and
configuration of resources in the documentation when using cert-manager
however, set-by-step tutorials are very useful for deploying these resources to
get to a final goal. Below is list of tutorials that you might find helpful:

- [Securing Ingresses with NGINX-Ingress and
  cert-manager](./acme/nginx-ingress.md): Tutorial for deploying NGINX into your
  cluster and securing the connection with an ACME certificate.
- [Securing an EKS Cluster with Venafi](./venafi/eks-venafi.md): Tutorial for
  creating an EKS cluster and securing an NGINX deployment with a Venafi issued
  certificate.

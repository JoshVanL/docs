# Syncing Secrets Across Namespaces using Kubed

It may be required for multiple components across namespaces to consume the same
secret that has been created by a single certificate. The recommended way to do
this is to use [kubed](https://github.com/appscode/kubed) with its [secret
syncing
feature](https://appscode.com/products/kubed/v0.11.0/guides/config-syncer/intra-cluster/).

# Contributing Flow

All of cert-manager's development is done via
[GitHub](github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) which contains code, issues and pull
requests.

# Bugs

All bugs should be tracked as issues inside the
[GitHub](github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues) repository. Issues should then be
attached with the `kind/bug` tag. This may then be assigned a priority and
milestone to be addressed in a future release.

The more logs and information you can give about what and how the bug has been
discovered, the faster it can be resolved.

Critical bug fixes are typically backported to the current minor stable release.

> Note: If you are simply looking for _troubleshooting_ then you should post
> your question to the community `cert-manager` [slack channel](slack.k8s.io).

# Feature

Feature requests should be created as
[GitHub](github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues) issues. They should contain
clear motivation for the feature you wish to see as well as some possible
solutions for how it can be implemented.

# DigitalOcean

This provider uses a Kubernetes `Secret` Resource to work. In the following
example, the secret will have to be named `digitalocean-dns` and have a subkey
`access-token` with the token in it.

To create a Personnal Access Token, see [DigitalOcean documentation](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/api/create-personal-access-token).
